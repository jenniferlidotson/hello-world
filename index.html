<p>Stand Up Paddle Boarding (or SUP) came about in the 1960s when Hawaiian surfers began standing on their longboards and using outrigger canoe paddles to venture out for a better view of the surf. SUP is a popular choice because it’s great fun, has a relatively easy learning curve and offers a spectacular and close-up view of enchanting marine life; and it is a safe activity for people of all ages, sizes, and athletic abilities.</p>
